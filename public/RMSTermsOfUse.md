Welcome to Red Mesa Studios\! These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your use of the mobile applications (each, an "Application" or collectively, "the Applications") provided by Red Mesa Studios LLC ("we," "us," or "our").

By downloading, installing, or using any of our Applications, you agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use our Applications.

We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to download, install, and use the Applications on a mobile device that you own or control, strictly in accordance with these Terms. The permitted use of an Application depends on its intended purpose:

* **(a) Personal Use License:** For Applications intended for personal entertainment or utility (e.g., games, weather apps, personal productivity tools), this license is limited to your **personal, non-commercial use**.  
* **(b) Commercial Use License:** For Applications explicitly designed and marketed by us for professional or business use (e.g., an appointment scheduling app for a business), this license is extended to permit your use of the Application for your **internal business operations**.

**4\. Subscriptions & In-App Purchases**  
Our Applications are free to download and may offer access to certain features at no cost ("Freemium Version"). Enhanced functionality may be available through in-app purchases, including:

* **Time-Based Subscriptions:** Payments for subscriptions (e.g., weekly, monthly, annually) will be charged to your Apple App Store or Google Play Store account ("App Store Account") at confirmation of purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal by going to your App Store Account settings after purchase.  
* **Lifetime Purchase:** A one-time payment may be offered for lifetime access to the premium features of a specific Application ("Lifetime Access"). This purchase is tied to your App Store Account and is non-transferable.

All billing and transaction processes are handled by the Apple App Store or Google Play Store, and are governed by their respective terms and conditions. We do not collect or process any payment information. All purchases are final and non-refundable, except as required by applicable law or the policies of the platform provider.
