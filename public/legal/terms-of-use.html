            <h4><strong>Terms of Use for Red Mesa Studios LLC Mobile Applications</strong></h4>
            <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> July 28, 2025</p>
            <p>Welcome to Red Mesa Studios! These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your use of the mobile applications (each, an "Application" or collectively, "the Applications") provided by Red Mesa Studios LLC ("we," "us," or "our").</p>
            <p>By downloading, installing, or using any of our Applications, you agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use our Applications.</p>
            <h5>1. Agreement to Terms</h5>
            <p>This is a legally binding agreement. You agree that you are at least 13 years old and that if you are between 13 and 18 years old, your parent or legal guardian has reviewed and agreed to these Terms. Our Applications are not intended for children under the age of 13.</p>
            <h5>2. License to Use Our Applications</h5>
            <p>We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to download, install, and use the Applications on a mobile device that you own or control, strictly in accordance with these Terms. The permitted use of an Application depends on its intended purpose:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>(a) Personal Use License:</strong> For Applications intended for personal entertainment or utility (e.g., games, weather apps, personal productivity tools), this license is limited to your <strong>personal, non-commercial use</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>(b) Commercial Use License:</strong> For Applications explicitly designed and marketed by us for professional or business use (e.g., an appointment scheduling app for a business), this license is extended to permit your use of the Application for your <strong>internal business operations</strong>. This Commercial Use License does not grant you the right to resell, re-license, or otherwise distribute the Application to third parties.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>3. Restrictions on Use</h5>
            <p>You agree not to, and you will not permit others to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>a. License, sell, rent, lease, assign, distribute, transmit, host, outsource, or otherwise commercially exploit the Applications.</li>
                <li>b. Modify, make derivative works of, disassemble, decrypt, reverse compile, or reverse engineer any part of the Applications.</li>
                <li>c. Remove, alter, or obscure any proprietary notice (including any notice of copyright or trademark) of Red Mesa Studios LLC or its affiliates, partners, or suppliers.</li>
                <li>d. Use the Applications for any illegal purpose, or in violation of any local, state, national, or international law.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>4. Subscriptions & In-App Purchases</h5>
            <p>Our Applications are free to download and may offer access to certain features at no cost ("Freemium Version"). Enhanced functionality may be available through in-app purchases, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Time-Based Subscriptions:</strong> Payments for subscriptions (e.g., weekly, monthly, annually) will be charged to your Apple App Store or Google Play Store account ("App Store Account") at confirmation of purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal by going to your App Store Account settings after purchase.</li>
                <li><strong>Lifetime Purchase:</strong> A one-time payment may be offered for lifetime access to the premium features of a specific Application ("Lifetime Access"). This purchase is tied to your App Store Account and is non-transferable.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All billing and transaction processes are handled by the Apple App Store or Google Play Store, and are governed by their respective terms and conditions. We do not collect or process any payment information. All purchases are final and non-refundable, except as required by applicable law or the policies of the platform provider.</p>
            <h5>5. Intellectual Property</h5>
            <p>The Applications, including all source code, content, features, functionality, trademarks, logos, and graphics (the "Intellectual Property") are owned by or licensed to Red Mesa Studios LLC, and are protected by copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws. You are granted no rights in or to the Intellectual Property other than the limited license granted in Section 2.</p>
            <h5>6. User-Generated Content</h5>
            <p>Our Applications are not designed for users to post, upload, or otherwise submit content. Therefore, any provisions related to user-generated content are not applicable.</p>
            <h5>7. Privacy Policy</h5>
            <p>Your use of the Applications is also governed by our Privacy Policy, which is incorporated by reference into these Terms. Our Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and disclose information about you.</p>
            <h5>8. Termination</h5>
            <p>These Terms are effective until terminated by you or us. We may terminate or suspend your access to our Applications at any time, without prior notice or liability, for any reason, including if you breach these Terms. You may terminate these Terms at any time by uninstalling the Application from your device.</p>
            <h5>9. Disclaimer of Warranties</h5>
            <p>THE APPLICATIONS ARE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE," WITH ALL FAULTS AND DEFECTS WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, WE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>

            <p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL RED MESA STUDIOS LLC OR ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, OR EMPLOYEES BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM YOUR USE OF THE APPLICATIONS. IN NO EVENT SHALL OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY EXCEED THE GREATER OF THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US, IF ANY, IN THE PAST SIX MONTHS FOR THE SERVICES GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM OR FIFTY U.S. DOLLARS ($50.00).</p>
            <h5>11. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution</h5>

            <h5>12. Changes to These Terms</h5>
